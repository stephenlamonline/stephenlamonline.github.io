## Hello, I'm Stephen 👋


I am a person with heavy procrastination symptoms, poor self-control, and a tendency to be lazy and easily satisfied. However, contrary to what my personality might suggest, I am not a 無藥可救 (hopeless) person. In fact, many of my relatives, friends, and even my girlfriend consider me to be excellent.

My life was relatively smooth for the first 19 years. Under pressure and with clear guidelines, I was able to perform well and often outcompete others in the given curriculum. Skills and knowledge were handed to me, and I learned them quickly, albeit passively.

Everything changed when I went to college. Suddenly, no one was forcing me to do anything; there were no heavy academic workloads and no packed schedules. I gained something I had never imagined—complete freedom. I could choose whatever I wanted: what to eat, when to sleep, what to play, which courses to take, and so on.

This newfound freedom made me panic. Unlike before, when I had a clear, designed path—go to a better high school, then get into a better university—I now had too many choices. Which field in my major did I want to focus on? What jobs did I want to pursue? Did I want to continue in academia and further my studies? If so, where should I go, and which field should I specialize in?

These questions constantly plagued my mind. Unlike math exams, there were no model answers for these life decisions. To be honest, I suffer from a degree of 選擇困難症 (decision paralysis). Faced with so many choices, I became overwhelmed and started procrastinating.

Fortunately, things have been getting better recently. I have slowly stepped out of my comfort zone and tried various activities: boxing, part-time jobs, internships, and...

**starting this blog**.

I had attempted blogging a few times before, but I was too lazy to maintain it, and the tools I used were more complicated than the ones I am using now. This time, I hope to succeed.

In this blog, I intend to document my technical notes, university-related issues, thoughts about the world, and interesting things around me. I would be really happy if my content can inspire those who read it.
