      <description>About Me I am a person with heavy procrastination symptoms, poor self-control, and a tendency to be lazy and easily satisfied. However, contrary to what my personality might suggest, I am not a 無藥可救 (hopeless) person. In fact, many of my relatives, friends, and even my girlfriend consider me to be excellent.&#xA;My life was relatively smooth for the first 19 years. Under pressure and with clear guidelines, I was able to perform well and often outcompete others in the given curriculum.</description>
