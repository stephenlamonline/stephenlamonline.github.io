  <h2 id="hello-im-stephen-">Hello, I&rsquo;m Stephen 👋</h2>
<p>I am a person with heavy procrastination symptoms, poor self-control, and a tendency to be lazy and easily satisfied. However, contrary to what my personality might suggest, I am not a 無藥可救 (hopeless) person. In fact, many of my relatives, friends, and even my girlfriend consider me to be excellent.</p>
<p>My life was relatively smooth for the first 19 years. Under pressure and with clear guidelines, I was able to perform well and often outcompete others in the given curriculum. Skills and knowledge were handed to me, and I learned them quickly, albeit passively.</p>
<p>Everything changed when I went to college. Suddenly, no one was forcing me to do anything; there were no heavy academic workloads and no packed schedules. I gained something I had never imagined—complete freedom. I could choose whatever I wanted: what to eat, when to sleep, what to play, which courses to take, and so on.</p>
<p>This newfound freedom made me panic. Unlike before, when I had a clear, designed path—go to a better high school, then get into a better university—I now had too many choices. Which field in my major did I want to focus on? What jobs did I want to pursue? Did I want to continue in academia and further my studies? If so, where should I go, and which field should I specialize in?</p>
<p>These questions constantly plagued my mind. Unlike math exams, there were no model answers for these life decisions. To be honest, I suffer from a degree of 選擇困難症 (decision paralysis). Faced with so many choices, I became overwhelmed and started procrastinating.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things have been getting better recently. I have slowly stepped out of my comfort zone and tried various activities: boxing, part-time jobs, internships, and&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>starting this blog</strong>.</p>
<p>I had attempted blogging a few times before, but I was too lazy to maintain it, and the tools I used were more complicated than the ones I am using now. This time, I hope to succeed.</p>
<p>In this blog, I intend to document my technical notes, university-related issues, thoughts about the world, and interesting things around me. I would be really happy if my content can inspire those who read it.</p>
